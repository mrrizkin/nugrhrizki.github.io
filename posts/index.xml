      <description>Recently, I spent an hour with one of my protégés demonstrating some common advanced techniques we use at Webflow. One of the techniques I showed them was memoization. Let&amp;rsquo;s learn what memoization is, why you might use it, and how do we write it from scratch.

      <description>The Power of 10 Rules were created in 2006 by Gerard J. Holzmann of the NASA/JPL Laboratory for Reliable Software. The rules are intended to eliminate certain C coding practices which make code difficult to review or statically analyze. These rules are a complement to the MISRA C guidelines and have been incorporated into the greater set of JPL coding standards.
Rules the ten rules are:
 Avoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion.</description>

      <description>NOTE!: There are many solutions to this problem. but this is my approach to solve the problem i&amp;rsquo;m facing
 The Problem type StringType = { baz: string; } type ObjectType = { foo: string; bar: number; } type MyType = ObjectType | StringType const MyFunction = (x: MyType): string =&amp;gt; { x.foo; // typescript error  x.bar; // typescript error  x.baz; // typescript error  return &amp;#34;&amp;#34; } My Solution type TypeIdentifier = &amp;#34;STRINGTYPE&amp;#34; | &amp;#34;OBJECTTYPE&amp;#34;; type StringType = { typeIdentifier: TypeIdentifier baz: string; } type ObjectType = { typeIdentifier: TypeIdentifier foo: string; bar: number; } type MyType = ObjectType | StringType; const MyFunction = (x: MyType): string | null =&amp;gt; { switch(x.</description>

      <description>I keep a little list of these by my desk for my own sick amusement (which is something that my pal oxguin reckons is not a fact to be shared out loud). If you like this little lot, then you would probably enjoy some of the prior art at wtfjs.
Comparison craziness Let’s start by making x an array with 0 in it.
var x = [0] // [0] It should equal itself, which is good.</description>
